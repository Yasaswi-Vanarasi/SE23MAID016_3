# Binary Search Tree (BST) Performance Evaluation

This Java repository contains code for evaluating the performance of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in a multithreaded context. It enables you to examine how a BST behaves concurrently with multiple threads, facilitating operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching within the tree.

## Overview
The code comprises the following key components:

1. **BST_Test.java**: This serves as the central class responsible for orchestrating the testing of the BST under multithreaded conditions.

2. **BinarySearchTree.java**: It encompasses the actual implementation of the binary search tree.

3. **ThreadID.java**: A utility class that assists in obtaining thread-specific identifiers.

4. **Counter.java**: A simple utility class used for tallying thread operations.

## Running the Test
To execute the performance test, you need to compile and run `BST_Test.java`. The program accepts command-line arguments to configure the test run, allowing you to specify the number of threads, the initial size of the tree (prefilled with random values), and the workload. The workload is represented as a string in the format "C-I-D," where:
- "C" signifies the percentage of contains operations.
- "I" signifies the percentage of insert operations.
- "D" signifies the percentage of delete operations.

Here's an example of how to initiate the program:

```shell
java BST_Test <num_threads> <prefill_size> <workload>
```

Replace `<num_threads>`, `<prefill_size>`, and `<workload>` with suitable values that align with your testing objectives.

## Testing Approach
The core approach of this code involves initializing a BST with a specified number of nodes and prefilling the tree with random values. Subsequently, multiple threads are spawned to carry out operations based on the predefined workload percentages. The program captures and reports the throughput achieved during the test, thereby offering insights into performance characteristics.

## Output Metrics
The program provides reports that encompass the following key metrics:

- `num_threads`: Indicates the number of threads utilized for the test.
- `totalOps`: Represents the total count of operations executed.
- `throughput`: This metric measures the rate of operations completed per second (ops/s).

## Example Output
The output generated by the program adheres to the following format:

```
BST_Test:num_threads:<num_threads>:totalOps:<totalOps>:throughput:<throughput> ops/s
```

## Conclusion
This code empowers you to assess the concurrent behavior of a binary search tree under diverse workloads and analyze its performance within a multi-threaded environment. You have the flexibility to customize the number of threads, the prefill size, and the workload distribution to suit your specific use case. Before running the program, ensure that you have Java installed on your system, and tailor the parameters to align with your precise testing requirements.
